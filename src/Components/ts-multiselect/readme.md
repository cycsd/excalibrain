Multiselect is based on https://gitlab.com/suszczyk.daniel/ts-multiselect/-/blob/master/webpack.prod.js
I moved the code into Excalibrain to modify the code and pass an origin element instead of an origin ID, so the code will work with Obsidian 0.15.0 popout windows.

Because the original code was on gitlab and not github, I opted against forking, to avoid having to use yet another git platform.
